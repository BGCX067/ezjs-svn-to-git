First off i will show you a simple examples that prints, Hello World! to the screen.

{{{
<html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript" src="ezjs.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">
zprint("Hello World!");
</script>
</body>
<html>
}}}
The big part off the program is the third line there. It tells the script to add the library.

The next big thing is the line of code that says:

{{{
zprint("Hello World!");
}}}

It is telling it to print hello world to the screen.
